Designed a web socket enabled realtime server to support multiplayer boardgame-style video games.

Implemented passwordless client authentication protocol that allows for a client to optionally represent more than 1 player in a game â€“ in an online multiplayer game, 3 people could play from the same computer while 2 other people play from their own computers.
